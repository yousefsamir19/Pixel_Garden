**Welcome, Player!**  
Your cozy, pixel-art companion for building habits and staying productive.

Pixel Garden is a fun and interactive web application designed to help you track your habits and tasks. It combines a charming pixel art aesthetic with gentle gamification to encourage consistency. Instead of a strict to-do list, your progress is visualized as a vibrant, growing garden.
