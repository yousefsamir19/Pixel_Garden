Hello, (username)! 🌟  
Welcome to your Pixel Garden — your very own safe and cozy space. 🌸  

First, let me introduce you to Emma.  
She’ll be your companion here — each day, you’ll check in with her and share whether you completed your task.  
Emma will be here to give you gentle support as you grow the habit you want to build. 🌱  

🤩 If you succeed, she’ll reward you with a beautiful flower 🌹😍  
😡 But if you skip it… you might just meet the Angry Duck 🔪🦆  

So be careful not to make Emma angry — she really doesn’t like being clicked 😉  

Now that you know the rules, let’s choose the habit or task you want to start building. 🌟
